## About this project

This project implements the following mesh deformation methods:

- biharmonic deformation
- As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP) deformation

Instructions for running the programs are provided in the [report](hw3-report-viz.pdf).

## Content

This repository contains the following directories and files:

- `images/`: screenshots of results and bugs.
- `input/`: input meshes provided with homework indstructions.
- `output/`: anchors data files from problem 0 and HTML files generated by Meshplot.
- `hw3_report-viz.pdf` and `hw3_report-viz.ipynb`: our report as PDF and Jupyter notebook.
- `problem1_derivations.pdf`: the paper derivations, as required by problem 1.
- `select_anchors.py` and `select_anchors_by_range_visual.ipynb`: our tools for selecting anchor vertices, as required by problem 0.
- `biharmonic_deformations.py`: our implementation of biharmonic deformation.
- `arap_deformations.py`: our implementation of ARAP deformation.
- `scripts.py`: the provided script file.

## Requirements

Meshplot is required to display the meshes.

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge meshplot
```

libigl python bindings are required:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge igl
```

The following libraries where also used:

- `numpy`: for math operations.
- `scipy.linalg`: for linear algebra operations.
- `scipy.sparse`: for sparse matrix objects.
- `scipy.sparse.linalg`: for sparse matrix operations.
- `json`: for handling of JSON files.
